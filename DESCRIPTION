Description: This package includes the amino acid compositions of reference
  proteomes of prokaryotic taxa, precomputed from protein sequences in the RefSeq
  database. The reference proteomes are combined with taxonomic classifications
  from the RDP Classifier (which can be supplied by the user) to generate
  reference proteomes of bacterial and archaeal communities. The community
  reference proteomes are used to compute chemical metrics including carbon
  oxidation state and stoichiometric hydration state. Example datasets are
  provided for communities in environmental redox and salinity gradients.
