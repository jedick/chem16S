Description: This package is designed to calculate chemical metrics (carbon
  oxidation state and stoichiometric hydration state) of reference proteomes for
  bacterial and archaeal communities. The user-input data are taxonomic
  classifications of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the RDP Classifier, which can
  be generated using either the default RDP training set or a separately
  available training set derived from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB). The
  package includes amino acid compositions of reference proteomes of genus-and
  higher-level taxa precomputed from the NCBI RefSeq database and manual mappings
  from RDP to RefSeq taxonomy, both described in Dick and Tan (2022)
  <doi:10.1007/s00248-022-01988-9>. Reference proteomes for genus- and
  higher-level taxa in the GTDB are also provided. The taxonomic classifications
  are combined with the included reference proteomes to generate the amino acid
  compositions of community reference proteomes, which are then used to calculate
  the chemical metrics. Example datasets are provided to show the trends of
  chemical metrics for communities in environmental redox and salinity gradients.
