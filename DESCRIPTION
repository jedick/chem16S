Description: Accepts RDP Classifier table of taxonomic assignments for environmental 16S rRNA sequences.
    Combines taxonomic abundances with RefSeq reference proteomes to compute amino acid composition of estimated community proteome (ECP).
    Outputs chemical metrics for ECP including carbon oxidation state and stoichiometric hydration state.
    Examples are shown for environmental redox and salinity gradients.
