Description: Calculation of chemical metrics of reference proteomes for
  bacterial and archaeal communities. Amino acid compositions of reference
  proteomes of taxa were precomputed from the NCBI RefSeq database as described
  in Dick and Tan (2023) <doi:10.1007/s00248-022-01988-9>; reference proteomes
  using the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) are also included. The user-provided
  data are taxonomic classifications generated by the RDP Classifier, or an
  object generated by the phyloseq package (on BioConductor) with OTU and
  taxonomy tables. The taxonomic classifications are combined with the reference
  proteomes to generate community reference proteomes, which are then used to
  calculate chemical metrics including carbon oxidation state and stoichiometric
  hydration state. Example datasets are provided to show the trends of chemical
  metrics for communities in environmental redox and salinity gradients and
  integration with the phyloseq package.
