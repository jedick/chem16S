Description: This package combines user-supplied RDP Classifier output with
    amino acid compositions of reference proteomes (precomputed from the RefSeq
    database) to generate estimated community proteomes. The estimated community
    proteomes are used to compute chemical metrics including carbon oxidation state
    and stoichiometric hydration state. Example datasets are provided for
    environmental redox and salinity gradients.
