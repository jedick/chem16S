Description: Combines taxonomic classifications of high-throughput 16S rRNA
  gene sequences with reference proteomes of archaeal and bacterial taxa to
  generate amino acid compositions of community reference proteomes. Calculates
  chemical metrics including carbon oxidation state (Zc), stoichiometric
  oxidation and hydration state (nO2 and nH2O), H/C, N/C, O/C, and S/C ratios,
  grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), isoelectric point (pI), protein
  length, and average molecular weight of amino acid residues. Uses precomputed
  reference proteomes for archaea and bacteria derived from the Genome Taxonomy
  Database (GTDB). Also includes reference proteomes derived from the NCBI
  Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database and taxonomic mapping from the RDP
  Classifier training set to RefSeq taxonomy as described by Dick and Tan (2023)
  <doi:10.1007/s00248-022-01988-9>. Processes taxonomic classifications in RDP
  Classifier format or as OTU tables in 'phyloseq-class' objects from the
  Bioconductor package 'phyloseq'.
