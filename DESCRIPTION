Description: This package is used to calculate chemical metrics (carbon oxidation
  state and stoichiometric hydration state) of reference proteomes for bacterial and
  archaeal communities. The user-input data are taxonomic classifications from
  the RDP Classifier, using either the default training set for 16S rRNA gene
  sequences, or an externally available training set derived from the Genome
  Taxonomy Database (GTDB). The package includes the amino acid compositions of
  reference proteomes of prokaryotic taxa precomputed from protein sequences in
  the RefSeq (NCBI) database or from marker proteins in the GTDB. The taxonomic
  classifications are combined with the included reference proteomes to generate
  the amino acid compositions of community reference proteomes, which are then used
  to calculate the chemical metrics. Example datasets are provided to show the trends
  of chemical metrics for communities in environmental redox and salinity gradients.
